1) HIDS vs NIDS 

HIDS is host intrusion detection system - placed on each host
NIDS is network intrusion detection system - placed in the network
Both the systems work on the similar lines. It’s just that the placement in different. 
For an enterprise, NIDS is preferred as HIDS is difficult to manage, plus it consumes processing power of the host as well.

2) How does tracert/traceroute work? What protocol does it use?
In case you can’t ping the final destination, tracert will help to identify where the connection stops or gets broken, whether it is 
firewall, ISP, router etc.
It actually keeps sending packets to the final destination; the only change is the TTL that’s used. The extra credit is the fact that 
Windows uses ICMP by default while Linux uses UDP

The Time To Live (TTL) field in an IP header was intended to hold the number of seconds for which the IP packet is valid, after which 
it can be dropped. In practice, it is used as a decrementing hop count, whereby every router that forwards the packet reduces the TTL 
value by one.

IP Packet Headers: Source, Destination, TimetoLive (TTL)
When TTL=0, router sends a message says "I dropped the packets"

3) DDoS and its mitigation?

DDoS= distributed denial of service. 
When a network/server/application is flooded with large number of requests which it is not designed to handle making the server 
unavailable to the legitimate requests. 

Common DDoS attacks types
UDP Flood: Flooding a target's random ports on a remote host with UDP packets and causing the host to repeatedly check for the 
application listening at that port, and (when no application is found) reply with an ICMP ‘Destination Unreachable’ packet. 

ICMP (Ping) Flood: Overwhelming the target resource with ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets, by sending packets as fast as possible 
without waiting for replies. This type of attack can consume both outgoing and incoming bandwidth, since the victim’s servers will 
often attempt to respond with ICMP Echo Reply packets, resulting a significant overall system slowdown.

SYN Flood: The requester sends multiple SYN requests, but either does not respond to the host’s SYN-ACK response, or sends the 
SYN requests from a spoofed IP address. Either way, the host system continues to wait for acknowledgement for each of the requests, 
binding resources until no new connections can be made, and ultimately resulting in denial of service

Ping of Death: Sending IP packet which is larger than 65,535 bytes that results in overflow of memory buffers allocated for the packet, 
causing denial of service for legitimate packets.

NTP Amplification: Exploits publicly-accessible NTP servers to overwhelm a targeted server with UDP traffic.
HTTP Flood: Exploits seemingly-legitimate HTTP GET or POST requests to attack a web server or application

Prevention Techniques:
Firewall and ACLs (Access Control Lists)
Analyze traffic formal abnormalities
Deploy application firewalls

4) What port does ping work over?
ICMP is a layer 3 protocol (it doesn’t work over a port) -Also, TCP and UDP are layer 4 protocols and not related to ping.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Do you prefer filtered ports or closed ports?
Closed Port: If you send a SYN to a closed port, it will respond back with a RST.
Filtered Port: Presumably, the host is behind some sort of firewall. Here, the packet is simply dropped and you receive no response 
(not even a RST).
Open Port: If you send a SYN to an open port, you would expect to receive SYN/ACK.

Different Cases  to Choose
Choose Closed Port: If the clients are waiting for the server answer and they were configured with a high connection timeout. 
Reject the connections, because external clients can display a quickly “Unable to connect” message.
Choose Filtered Ports: If your server is used as website that can be targeted by a DDoS attacks then choose the “DROP” policy because 
in this way your firewall is not going to consume CPU and bandwidth answering about the state of the port (Sending back ICMP messages).

6) How would you build the ultimate botnet? Best way to create a botnet?
a blending of the words “robot” and “network”.
To build a botnet, botmasters need as many infected online devices or “bots” under their command as possible. The more bots connected, 
the bigger the botnet. The bigger the botnet, the bigger the impact. 
Botnet Structures usually take one of two forms, and each structure is designed to give the botmaster as much control as possible.

Client-server model: The client-server botnet structure is set up like a basic network with one main server controlling the transmission 
of information from each client. The botmaster uses special software to establish command and control (C&C) servers to relay 
instructions to each client device.

Peer-to-peer: In a P2P botnet, each infected device functions as a client and a server. Individual bots have a list of other infected 
devices and will seek them out to update and to transmit information between them. 

Pro's of P2P:
P2P botnet structures make it harder for law enforcement to locate any centralized source. 
The lack of a single C&C server also makes P2P botnets harder to disrupt.

7) How does TOR network work?
The Tor network runs through the computer servers of thousands of volunteers (over 4,500 at time of publishing) spread throughout the 
world. Your data is bundled into an encrypted packet when it enters the Tor network. Then, unlike the case with normal Internet 
connections, Tor strips away part of the packet's header, which is a part of the addressing information that could be used to learn 
things about the sender such as the operating system from which the message was sent.
Finally, Tor encrypts the rest of the addressing information, called the packet wrapper. Regular Internet connections don't do this.

8) What is ARP Poisoning? Which tools are used?
ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area 
network. This results in the linking of an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.
Ettercap - Linux Arp poisoning and password sniffing tool
Cain Abel - Windows network sniffing tool

9) What is SNMP? What are the differences between public and private community strings?
Simple Network Management Protocol.
a standard way of monitoring hardware and software from nearly any manufacturer
Required basic components to work:
A management station: a software that collects information from your network
An agent: it collects information, and then sends it to the monitoring station when polled

SNMP versions: v1, v2c, and v3
A major weakness of v1 and v2c: Community strings  (the equivalent of passwords) are transmitted in clear text and there is no support 
for authentication

Ports:
UDP 161: Used when management stations communicate with agents
UDP 162: Used when agents send unsolicited Traps to the management station

OIDs (Object Identifier): SNMP works by querying “Objects”. An object is simply something that we can gather information about on a 
network device. For instance, an object might be something like Interface Status. Querying Interface Status would return a variable – 
the interface could be Up, or Down. SNMP identifies objects like with an Object Identifier, or OID.

MIBs (Management Information Base): It is like a translator that helps a Management Station to understand SNMP responses obtained from 
your network devices. All SNMP devices generally support something called MIB-2, which is a standard set of objects that can be 
monitored. 

Community Strings: They are like passwords and used to allow authorized users to access the SNMP agent on a device. Many admins never 
change community strings from the defaults “Public” for read-only, and “Private” for read-write.

To provide Security:
Disable SNMP service if it is not required.
If SNMP service is required, make sure that the default community strings are made complex.
Make sure that SNMP service is not misconfigured with read-write authorization.

10) What is OSI model and its layers?

Trick to Remember: All people seem to need data processing

Layer 7: Application - (End User Layer: HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS)
Layer 6: Presentation - (Syntax Layer: )
Layer 5: Session - (Synch & send to port: APIs, Sockets, WinSock)
Layer 4: Transport - (End-to-end Connections: TCP, UDP)
Layer 3: Network - (Packets: IP, ICMP, IPSec)
Layer 3: Data Link - (Frames: Ethernet, Switch, Bridge, PPP [point-to-point protocol])
Layer 1: Physical - (Physical Structure: Fiber, Wireless, Hubs)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11) Firewall on Layer 7 vs Layer 3? Which one is better?
Layer 3: categorize traffic according to IP addresses, port numbers and service protocols. Layer 3 firewalls filter traffic based on 
the TCP/IP stack

Layer 7: Rather than simply blocking all traffic on a certain port, you could use an application firewall to accept traffic on that 
port in general, but block any traffic that contains a known vulnerability (like an SQL injection attack or a malicious telnet command).

Comment: The best model for most scenarios is to use multiple layers of defense in depth. Specifically, have an L3 firewall at the edge 
that only allows inbound traffic on the specific ports your apps use. Those ports should then be routed to an L7 firewall for deep 
inspect at the app protocol level. This model leverages the strengths of each approach with the L3 firewall efficiently dropping all 
packets but those from allowed sources and destined to allowed ports, thus allowing the L7 firewall to focus exclusively on inspecting 
the content of the requests to those ports. [quoted]

12) How do you protect your Wireless Access Point?
Use stronger encryption - WPA2
Use a secure WPA password  
Provide a separate network for guests
Enable MAC authentication for your users

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13) TCP vs UDP
Both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are protocols used for sending bits of data — known as packets 
— over the Internet. They both build on top of the Internet protocol. In other words, whether you are sending a packet via TCP or UDP, 
that packet is sent to an IP address. These packets are treated similarly, as they are forwarded from your computer to intermediary 
routers and on to the destination.

TCP and UDP are not the only protocols that work on top of IP. However, they are the most widely used. The widely used term "TCP/IP" 
refers to TCP over IP. 
UDP over IP could just as well be referred to as "UDP/IP", although this is not a common term.

TCP guarantees the recipient will receive the packets in order by numbering them. The recipient sends messages back to the sender saying
it received the messages.

When using UDP, packets are just sent to the recipient. The sender will not wait to make sure the recipient received the packet — it 
will just continue sending the next packets. UDP is used when speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary.

14) What is the Three-way handshake? How can it be used to create a DOS attack?
Host A sends a TCP SYNchronize packet to Host B
Host B receives A's SYN
Host B sends a SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement
Host A receives B's SYN-ACK
Host A sends ACKnowledge
Host B receives ACK. 
TCP socket connection is ESTABLISHED.
